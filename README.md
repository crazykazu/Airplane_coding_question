Coding Question

-The main question is to find the fastest way from one airport to another
-Given the airport class
-Also that theoretically all flights can make it to the destination but we want to find the fastest one
-Have to use recursion in oreder to return the shortest list from one airport to another
-Gonna make a more complicated one later but this is just a test one
